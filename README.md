# Dimensional Modeling: Snowflake and Data Exploration

Snowflake model made by separating a flat table into several tables. Two scripts were needed to make this modeling and one more to explore the data: 
- create_tables: contains (ddl) create as name of a script suggests
- fill_tables: contains (dml) insert and select queries to fill newly created tables
- exploration: some business questions to answer divided into easy, medium, and advanced queries
